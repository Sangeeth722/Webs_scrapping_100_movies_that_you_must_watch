<h1>Webs_scrapping_100_movies_that_you_must_watch</h1>
<h2>project</h2>
<p>
  Scrape the top 100 movies of all time from a website. Generate a text file
  called movies.txt that lists the movie titles in ascending order (starting
  from 1). The result should look something like this:
</p>
<ul>
  1)
  <b>The Godfather</b>
  <br />
  2)
  <b>The Empire Strikes Back</b>
  <br / > 3)
  <b>The Dark Knight</b>
  <br / > 4)
  <b>The Shawshank Redemption </b>
  ... and so on
</ul>

<p>
  The central idea behind this project is to be able to use BeautifulSoup to
  obtain some data - like movie titles - from a website like Empire's (or from,
  say Timeout or Stacker that have curated similar lists).
